# Cratejoy Themes

Included in our themes are a variety of simple to advanced themes that
you can customize to make your store your own.

Check the code out for yourself to see how our themes are put together!

If you're putting a theme together from scratch, you can use the
skeleton theme as a starting point for basic theme functionality.

## Old vs. New Designer

We released a new designer and theme format in June 2016. If you're customizing an existing theme, make sure you know
[which designer you're using](https://help.cratejoy.com/hc/en-us/articles/211679366-Do-I-have-the-new-designer-or-the-old-designer-)
before you get started. This repository contains themes for both the old and new designer.

If you're building a new theme, you can only use the new designer and new theme format, based on components. Learn more
about components and theme settings in [our developer documentation](http://docs.cratejoy.com/docs/settings).
